The program reads in a CSV file containing records for multiple students, and it uses this data to train a linear regression model using the ordinary least squares method. The model is then evaluated on a test set and the results are displayed in a scatter plot, where the predicted values are plotted against the true values. In addition to the model training and evaluation, the program also has a GUI built with tkinter that allows users to input their own data and receive a prediction from the model. The program leverages several external libraries including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
